## Introduction
In the era of rapid technological advancements, the AI-TTS-Translator stands out by merging two powerful domains: translation and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. By utilizing OpenAI, the project ensures accurate and context-aware translations. This translated text is then fed into ElevenLabs' TTS system, known for its realistic and human-like voice outputs. The integration of multi-threading techniques further accelerates the voice conversion process, enabling multiple translations to be converted to spe...

## Features
- Translate text from one language to another using OpenAI.
- Convert translated text into audible, realistic speech with ElevenLabs.
- Achieve faster voice synthesis through multi-threading for parallel conversions.
